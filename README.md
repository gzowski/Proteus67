# Proteus67 - Ortholinear mechanical keyboard

* 67 Key ortholinear design, inspiration taken from the split design of the Sofle/Lily58 and Planck
* 33 keys per hand
* 1 Rotary encoder in the middle (Green)
* Additional column positioned each side down the centre. (Orange)
* Single microcontroller design while retaining characteristics of a split layout
* 133mm finger spacing while hands are at home positions (F/J keys) in a QWERTY layout. (Blue)

### Parts (Optional):
| Part | Quantity     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| LED Strip | 1 | WS2812 Compatible (30cm) |

### Assembly Guide

* Place both stabalizers into the top plate
* Insert all switches into the top plate and put to the side
* Diode installation: Choose which side you want the diodes on, they can be fitted either side. (Personal preference on the rear)
  * SMD mounting: Use smaller diode points marked below, ensure diodes are facing the correct orientation
  * Through-Hole mounting: Use the wider spacing through-holes, ensuring diodes are facing the correct orrientation.
    * Snip additional length off legs on opersite side.
