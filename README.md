# Proteus67 - Ortholinear mechanical keyboard

* 67 Key ortholinear design, inspiration taken from the split design of the Sofle/Lily58.
* 33 keys per side and rotary encoder in the middle.
* Additional column positioned each side down the centre.
* Single PCB and microcontroller design while retaining the feel of a split board.
* 133mm finger spacing while hands are at home positions (F/J keys) in a QWERTY layout.
